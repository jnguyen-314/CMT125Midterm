			</p><br>
			<p>
The pandemic is impacting all of us in different ways, many of which could affect your participation in class. This
could mean that you or someone you take care of has become sick or that your work, childcare, or living situations
have changed. If at some point during this semester the pandemic impacts your ability to participate in class or meet
assignment deadlines, please contact me as soon as possible. While I donâ€™t need to know all of the details of your
circumstances, knowing as early as possible that you are experiencing challenges can help me connect you to
college resources that can provide support

				<span class="bold underline">Course Description</span>
			</p><br>
			<p>
This course will cover the incorporation of modern web design controls for the formatting, placement, dynamics,
interactive functionality, and animation web page content with CSS. CSS is the primary technology in use today in the
fast paced world of web design and is used to present web content in a standardized manner that far exceeds the
capabilities of the HTML language.
		</p><br><br>
			<p>
				<span class="bold underline">Attendance</span>
			</p><br>
			<p>
Students are required to attend all scheduled classes. While some absences may be unavoidable the student must
make a conscientious effort to be in class. It is the student's responsibility to submit any work that was due on the
date of an absence. It is also the student's responsibility to pursue the lessons taught on the date of an absence.
Material that was covered on the date of an absence will not be covered again unless deemed necessary.<br><br>
The student's attendance will be considered as part of the final grade.

				<span class="bold underline">Teaching Procedure</span>

assignments, and exam projects.
			</p><br><br>
			<p>
				<span class="bold underline">Student Code of Conduct</span>
			</p><br>
			<p>
Students are required to adhere to the BHCC policy on dishonesty, including cheating and plagiarism. Cheating on
examinations or tests consists of knowingly giving, receiving, or using, or attempting to give, receive or use,
unauthorized assistance. Other forms of cheating include copying or purchasing other's work or arranging for others to
do work under a false name. Forms of plagiarism include the submission of the work of another source or person
without giving proper acknowledgement or credit to that source or individual. This would also include unacknowledged
paraphrasing of the work of another or others either by direct quote or rewording another person's idea, thought or
work.

			</p><br><br>
			<p>
				<span class="bold underline">Homework</span>
			</p><br>
			<p>
There will be weekly assignments which the student is expected complete and submit by the required submission date.
Any extension for homework completion must be negotiated with the instructor prior to the completion date
			</p><br><br>
			<p>
				<span class="bold underline">Exams</span>
			</p><br>
			<p>
There will be a midterm exam and a final exam in this course. These exams will be in the form of projects where the
student will be provided some unformatted HTML files and will be expected to format them into an effective web
presentation using CSS.

			<p>
				<span class="bold underline">Software Requirements</span>
			</p><br>
			<p>
The student will need to have access to a text editing software application in order to construct CSS styles. The
Notepad application will be adequate for writing CSS. However using Notepad Plus would be a better alternative
because it uses code coloring which helps greatly. If you are currently enrolled in the HTML &amp; Dreamweaver class then
using Dreamweaver would be a much better alternative.
